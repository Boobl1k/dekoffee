# Review rules

* reviewer opens thread about every problem they see in the code
* performer comments each open thread in each review cycle
* if reviewer agreed with new code changes 
(or any other reason why they are convinced that the problem is gone), 
they resolve the thread
* if reviewer still does not agree with changes, 
they have to comment the thread and give more explanations about the problem
* in order to solve the problem performer opens a new issue and refers
to it in comment or makes changes in current PR 
(and also comments about new changes under the thread).
The second way is better
